#   Notes about using this file:
#
#   Buildozer uses a variant of Python's ConfigSpec to read this file.
#   For the basic syntax, including interpolations, see
#       https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure
#
#   Warning: Comments cannot be used "inline" - i.e.
#       [app]
#       title = My Application # This is not a comment, it is part of the title.
#
#   Warning: Indented text is treated as a multiline string - i.e.
#       [app]
#       title = My Application
#          package.name = myapp # This is all part of the title.
#
#   Buildozer's .spec files have some additional features:
#
#   Buildozer supports lists - i.e.
#       [app]
#       source.include_exts = py,png,jpg
#       #                     ^ This is a list.
#
#       [app:source.include_exts]
#       py
#       png
#       jpg
#       # ^ This is an alternative syntax for a list.
#
#   Buildozer's option names are case-sensitive, unlike most .ini files.
#
#   Buildozer supports overriding options through environment variables.
#   Name an environment variable as SECTION_OPTION to override a value in a .spec
#   file.
#
#   Buildozer support overriding options through profiles.
#   For example, you want to deploy a demo version of your application without
#   HD content. You could first change the title to add "(demo)" in the name
#   and extend the excluded directories to remove the HD content.
#
#       [app@demo]
#       title = My Application (demo)
#
#       [app:source.exclude_patterns@demo]
#       images/hd/*
#
#   Then, invoke the command line with the "demo" profile:
#
#        buildozer --profile demo android debug
#
#   Environment variable overrides have priority over profile overrikivy,re
